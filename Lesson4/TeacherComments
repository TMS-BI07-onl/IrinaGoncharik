Where is the answer?

b)
In this task there was no requirements to create new table. 
You can insert multiple rows by having it divided by comma, like this:
INSERT INTO Production.UnitMeasure
VALUES 
('TT1', 'Test1', '2020-09-09'),
('TT2','Test2',GETDATE())

I don't see the creation of UnitMeasureTest here.
Yes, "ordered rows" means you need to use order by.
SELECT *			
FROM Production.UnitMeasureTest
ORDER BY UnitMeasureCode

Row_number is not the best option here. For generating "list of best..." it's better to use rank or dense_rank.
I expected using ISNULL function for TerritoryGroup for replacing nulls.
...CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(LastName, 3)), 'login', ISNULL(TerritoryGroup, ''))AS [login]...

You need to have one code for all options. You can't manually edit it for every result. Use case to check the condition.
