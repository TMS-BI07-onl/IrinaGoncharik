Well done!

2. Min salary is also supposed to be calculated without commision_pct.

3. a) You didn't add a column name in the order by section.

4. The task was to calcualate the difference between two avg's.

5. -1.5
You have the whole job_history table for this purpose.

6. It's not pretty at all to have big range in the IN. Better use <,> or BETWEEN.

Total: almostly correct, but a list of small comments. Seems, that it's not a good idea to solve tasks after the lesson. :)
