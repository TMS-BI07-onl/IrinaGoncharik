4. 
a) -1 
Correct answer: ... WHERE LastName LIKE 'M%' OR NOT EmailPromotion LIKE '%1%'. 
Second condition is not "equal", it's "including". For example, if after next data update there is a EmailPromotion 3451654, it should be added to the final result set.
b) -1 
Correct answer: SELECT  TOP 3   *
		FROM Sales.SpecialOffer
		WHERE StartDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2014-01-01'
		ORDER BY DiscountPct DESC
Order by is the most important part of this task. Your script is showing just 3 random rows with max price for the certain period. But it's not max prices for the whole table.
